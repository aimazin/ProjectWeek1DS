## Data Cleansing and EDA
This is just a project that demonstrates that it may be possible to keep all data in a set in order to have it more representitive of a data collection process and it's source. This process will enlighten data management and curation.

## The Files

raw_house_data.csv - is housing data collected from a previously unkown source by unkown persons

Projectweek1.ipynb - a notebook using Python3 was used for cleansing and EDA

## Approach

Did not want to get rid of outliers as it representive of the process. However most relevant values for missing Nan and None and a check for duplicates was made.
